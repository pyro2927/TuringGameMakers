## Information

### Game Engines

Game engines are tools and frameworks that help make game development easier. Just like Rails accelerates making a Ruby backend, or React helps speed up Javascript frontend development, engines take care of most of the boilerplate things in game development so the actual **game** can be focused on. Compared to things like Rails and React however, they're very big. Unreal Engine 5 is roughly 100Gb once installed on your machine.

#### Download and Setup Unreal

1. Create an [Unreal account](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) if needed (if you've made an account to play Fortnite you can use that)
2. [Download the Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
3. Install Unreal Engine 5.2 by using the launcher (click "Unreal Engine" on the left, "Library" at the top, the "+" next to "Engine Versions", and finally "Install" within the "5.2.0" box that appears)

Depending on your internet speed, it may take several minutes or several hours to download Unreal Engine.
