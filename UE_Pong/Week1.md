# Welcome to Week 1

## Goals

* Get comfortable with the Unreal Editor
* Have a basic understanding of what an [Actor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/actors-and-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) is
* Start the basic level layout for Pong

## Information

### Unreal Editor

Unreal has a [wealth of documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/understanding-the-basics-of-unreal-engine/). Feel free to look at it, but don't be discouraged if you don't understand everything. What's important for this week is getting familiar with the [Unreal Editor Interface](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/unreal-editor-interface/).

### Actors

[Actors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/actors-and-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) are the building blocks of video game worlds. As Unreal puts it:

> An Actor is any object that can be placed into a Level, such as a camera, Static Mesh, or player start location.

Knowing that, we need to break down the game of Pong into its various actors. To start, we can use four: 1 x ball, 2 x paddles, 1 x camera.

### Cameras

[Cameras](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/using-cameras-in-unreal-engine/) are what allow players to see in your game! While there are many different kinds of ways to use cameras, Pong will use a fixed camera that looks at the objects in the game (paddles, ball, scores, etc).

## Bonus Levels

### Lyra

If you want to dive into a complex game that Epic has made available to showcase Unreal, search the Epic Store for ["Lyra"](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/). It is a full game that you can download and open up in the Unreal Editor to see exactly how it works.
