# Pong

The goal of this project is to cover the fundamentals of game development. It is broken up into small chunks every week for asynchronous learning.

## Expectations

### This *IS*

* A place to learn how to make your first game
* A high level overview of game development and the tools that are used

### This is *NOT*

* A place to gain deep expertise in C++/C#
* Information on how to write the best ray-tracing algorithm

## Requirements

Any Mac purchased by Turing within the past few years should meet Unreal's [hardware requirements](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine/). Feel free to use a beefier desktop if you have one though.

**110+ Gb of storage space available.**
